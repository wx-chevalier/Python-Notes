Text Editors
::::::::::::

Just about anything that can edit plain text will work for writing Python code;
however, using a more powerful editor may make your life a bit easier.


Vim
---

Vim is a text editor which uses keyboard shortcuts for editing instead of menus
or icons. There are a couple of plugins and settings for the Vim editor to
aid Python development. If you only develop in Python, a good start is to set
the default settings for indentation and line-wrapping to values compliant with
:pep:`8`. In your home directory, open a file called :file:`.vimrc` and add the
following lines::

    set textwidth=79  " lines longer than 79 columns will be broken
    set shiftwidth=4  " operation >> indents 4 columns; << unindents 4 columns
    set tabstop=4     " a hard TAB displays as 4 columns
    set expandtab     " insert spaces when hitting TABs
    set softtabstop=4 " insert/delete 4 spaces when hitting a TAB/BACKSPACE
    set shiftround    " round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'
    set autoindent    " align the new line indent with the previous line

With these settings, newlines are inserted after 79 characters and indentation
is set to 4 spaces per tab. If you also use Vim for other languages, there is a
handy plugin called indent_, which handles indentation settings for Python
source files.

There is also a handy syntax plugin called syntax_ featuring some improvements
over the syntax file included in Vim 6.1.

These plugins supply you with a basic environment for developing in Python. To
get the most out of Vim, you should continually check your code for syntax
errors and PEP8 compliance. Luckily pycodestyle_ and Pyflakes_ will do this
for you. If your Vim is compiled with ``+python`` you can also utilize some
very handy plugins to do these checks from within the editor.

For PEP8 checking and pyflakes, you can install vim-flake8_. Now you can map the
function ``Flake8`` to any hotkey or action you want in Vim. The plugin will
display errors at the bottom of the screen, and provide an easy way to jump to
the corresponding line. It's very handy to call this function whenever you save
a file. In order to do this, add the following line to your
:file:`.vimrc`::

    autocmd BufWritePost *.py call Flake8()

If you are already using syntastic_, you can set it to run Pyflakes on write
and show errors and warnings in the quickfix window. An example configuration
to do that which also shows status and warning messages in the statusbar would
be::

    set statusline+=%#warningmsg#
    set statusline+=%{SyntasticStatuslineFlag()}
    set statusline+=%*
    let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list=1
    let g:syntastic_loc_list_height=5


Python-mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

Python-mode_ is a complex solution for working with Python code in Vim.
It has:

- Asynchronous Python code checking (``pylint``, ``pyflakes``, ``pycodestyle``, ``mccabe``) in any combination
- Code refactoring and autocompletion with Rope
- Fast Python folding
- Virtualenv support
- Search through Python documentation and run Python code
- Auto pycodestyle_ error fixes

And more.

SuperTab
^^^^^^^^

SuperTab_ is a small Vim plugin that makes code completion more convenient by
using ``<Tab>`` key or any other customized keys.

Interpreter Tools
:::::::::::::::::


Virtual Environments
--------------------

Virtual Environments provide a powerful way to isolate project package dependencies. This means that you can use packages particular to a Python project without installing them system wide and thus avoiding potential version conflicts.

To start using and see more information:
`Virtual Environments <https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide/blob/master/docs/dev/virtualenvs.rst>`_ docs.


pyenv
-----

`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ is a tool to allow multiple versions
of the Python interpreter to be installed at the same time.  This solves the
problem of having different projects requiring different versions of Python.
For example, it becomes very easy to install Python 2.7 for compatibility in
one project, while still using Python 3.4 as the default interpreter.
pyenv isn't just limited to the CPython versions – it will also install PyPy,
Anaconda, miniconda, stackless, Jython, and IronPython interpreters.

pyenv works by filling a ``shims`` directory with fake versions of the Python
interpreter (plus other tools like ``pip`` and ``2to3``).  When the system
looks for a program named ``python``, it looks inside the ``shims`` directory
first, and uses the fake version, which in turn passes the command on to
pyenv.  pyenv then works out which version of Python should be run based on
environment variables, ``.python-version`` files, and the global default.

pyenv isn't a tool for managing virtual environments, but there is the plugin
`pyenv-virtualenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv>`_ which automates
the creation of different environments, and also makes it possible to use the
existing pyenv tools to switch to different environments based on environment
variables or ``.python-version`` files.

Other Tools
:::::::::::

IDLE
----

:ref:`IDLE <python:idle>` is an integrated development environment that is
part of the Python standard distribution. It is completely written in Python and uses

experiment with different features in Python.

It provides the following features:

* Python Shell Window (interpreter)
* Multi window text editor that colorizes Python code
* Minimal debugging facility
