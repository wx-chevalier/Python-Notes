From the `official Python website <http://python.org/about/>`_:

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language similar
to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java. Some of its main key features
include:

* **very clear, readable syntax**

  Python's philosophy focuses on readability, from code blocks
  delineated with significant whitespace to intuitive keywords in
  place of inscrutable punctuation.

* **extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually
  any task**

  Python is sometimes described with the words "batteries included"
  because of its extensive
  `standard library <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_, which includes
  modules for regular expressions, file IO, fraction handling,
  object serialization, and much more.

  Additionally, the
  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_ is available
  for users to submit their packages for widespread use, similar to
  Perl's `CPAN <https://www.cpan.org>`_. There is a thriving community
  of very powerful Python frameworks and tools like
  the `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_ web framework and the
  `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ set of math routines.

* **integration with other systems**

  Python can integrate with `Java libraries <http://www.jython.org>`_,
  enabling it to be used with the rich Java environment that corporate
  programmers are used to. It can also be
  `extended by C or C++ modules <http://docs.python.org/extending/>`_
  when speed is of the essence.

* **ubiquity on computers**

  Python is available on Windows, \*nix, and Mac. It runs wherever the
  Java virtual machine runs, and the reference implementation CPython
  can help bring Python to wherever there is a working C compiler.

* **friendly community**

  Python has a vibrant and large :ref:`community <the-community>`
  which maintains wikis, conferences, countless repositories,
  mailing lists, IRC channels, and so much more. Heck, the Python
  community is even helping to write this guide!

Purpose
~~~~~~~

The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python exists to provide both novice and expert
Python developers a best practice handbook for the installation, configuration,
and usage of Python on a daily basis.
